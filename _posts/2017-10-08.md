Very excited to happen across the [Open Logic Project](https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic), while I was browsing through one of my favorite blogs, Peter Smith's [Logic Matters](http://www.logicmatters.net).

Not sure how I can contribute, but for now I'll enjoy inspecting the project so far, and, if nothing else, pick up some new tricks for LaTeX logic notation.

Not incidentally, but very important, I'd like to thank [Barry Clark](https:www.github.com/barryclark) for making available his rough-and-ready template for a basic github blog -- I'm sure I'm not the only one who is a little more comfortable with a few terse lines of code, or well-crafted prose, than the pictures and stuff.

Music, natural languages, and code.  Kind of says it all.
