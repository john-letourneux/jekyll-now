Very excited to have happened across the [Open Logic Project](https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic), while I was browsing through one of my favorite blogs, Peter Smith's [Logic Matters](http://www.logicmatters.net).

For now I'll enjoy inspecting the project so far, and seeing if I can contribute; if nothing else, I enjoy picking up some new tricks in LaTeX, and it is always interesting to see how new voices present familiar material.  

Not at all incidentally, but rather very important, in my first post I'd like to thank Barry Clark for his generosity in making available his [Jekyll Now](https:www.github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) template for a basic GitHub blog -- I'm sure I'm not the only one who is a little more comfortable with a few terse lines of code, or well-crafted prose, than the pictures and stuff.  Web design is not a sorcery, but I'm happy to delegate the task to the brave.

Well, I'm going to spend the rest of my evening examining the Open Logic Text, and putting some elbow grease back into the Contrapunctus 9 from the Ars Fuga, on the piano.  Next to the fugue from the E minor Partita, this is about the longest fugue I've put serious work on.  Challenging to keep lengthy fugues in your head, if one is, like me, one of those musicians who perversely insists that, in general, music should be played by heart, when one is not improvising in such-and-such an idiom; however, very far from impossible if one follows the thread of each voice with enough attention.

Likely there's an analogy to an undiscovered data structure, but we'll have to wait until it's known.
